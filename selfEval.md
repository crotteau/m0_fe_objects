# Self-Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges? 
    **It felt good that I was able to progress through the questions/challenges without too much difficulty.** 

- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.? 
    **I could be more focused and disciplined with my time spent working on this assignment. Since I had a week to work on it, I didn't feel as much urgency to complete the assignment and would become easily distracted. I guess I was good about taking breaks though..** 

- What did you learn from this exercise that you want to remember as you begin Mod 1?
    **I think the most important skill I want to apply for Mod 1 is to really think about what the question is asking and how I want to complete it without immediately referencing the curriculum. Recalling the information on my own will ultimately aid in my understanding down the line and help me commit it to memory.**
